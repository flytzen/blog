There is little doubt that agile methodologies are better than waterfall. As developers we can see the massive inefficiences that come with trying (and failing) to nail everything down up front. Management methodologies like GIST and development methodologies like Scrum/Kanban/XP whatever are inherently better at delivering a better product at a lower cost. I know that and you know that.

Yet, so often we are faced with business people who insist on waterfall and we are left baffled as to why they deliberately choose a path that is more expensive and less likely to be successful.

The first step to overcoming a rift like this is to try to understand the other side. In this post I will lay out some of the reasons why business people often favor waterfall methodologies. I am not asking you to agree with their position, but by understanding it, you will probably be much more effective in figuring out a smart way of working together.

I have written [another post] that talks about how you can apply at least some agile principles to fixed-scope/fixed-price projects.

## Agile business management is really hard
keeping eyes on the prize is actually really hard. easily becomes code & fix. Waterfall let's the business decide once and then delegate to a professional PM. It *can* deliver more value (if only becuase they mess the other option up)

## A business is an optimisation algorithm
stack-rank
discuss the uncertainty on everything and recommend GIST

## The need for a fixed budget
especially when additional funding is hard.
In many ways this can be phsycological - but it;s real in the sense that if only a fixed amount of money is available to achieve a specific set of business outcomes then you need to know what and how much.
You absolutely can argue that this is a fallacy (even though this is not always true) - but it won't feel like a fallacy to the business person and you have to work within that. Rather than trying to convince them they are wrong, agree the important outcomes and an initial estimate for those and agree to manage those core things closely. But leave as much other stuff to be decided later and try to get an experiment out as early as possible to start unpicking those assumptions about what "must" be included (because a lot of that will usually be wrong)

## Sub optimisation
At the end of the day, a business person in a larger organisation will usually optimise for what improves their career and makes their daily life more bearable rather than optimising for what is right for their business. So look at the culture they operate in and try to understand what actually matters to them.
- Does the culture cherish people who run big projects? Good luck trying for an "incremental improvement" approach there.
- Is there a fear culture? Do people get punished for failures? Expect a focus on minimising risk, no matter how much it reduces the value of the project.
- What makes the business person's life easier on a daily basis?

It boils down to looking at what is rewarding to the individual, which depends both on the culture of their organisation and their personality. While none of these things are likely to lead to optimal outcomes, you can at least understand why things are the way they are and try to work within those boundaries.
