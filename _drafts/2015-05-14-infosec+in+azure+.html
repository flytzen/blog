<p dir="ltr">Microsoft Azure has incredible technical security as well as accreditation for a whole host of security standards, including ISOnnn (link to the relevant site). That doesn't mean you or your application is compliant or that you will pass a security review. <br>In this post i will look at how easy - or not - it is to pass muster when inspected by Information Security (InfoSec) specialists when your app is hosted on Azure. I am not going to look at application security - the kind of things picked up in penetration tests, expect where there is an overlap. InfoSec is a lot more concerned with processes and policy than it is with application security - to the point where you can perversely be pushed towards lowering actual security in order to comply with standards. <br>The background to this is that at NewOrbit we have developed and continue to maintain a range of systems hosted on Azure, many of them containing highly sensitive data. I am far from being an InfoSec expert but I have answered enough questionnaires and worked on enough compliance to understand how to be compliant with a range of principles. </p><p dir="ltr"><b>What </b><b>is InfoSec </b><b>and InfoSec </b><b>standards </b><br>As application developers we all do a lot of work to make sure our applications are secure from hackers (we are, right?). If you are looking for information about how to do that, you can do a lot worse than look at Troy Hunt's courses on Pluralsight. For the rest of this post I am going to assume you have already got that aspect sorted. Much as application security is important, most real data breaches are done via the human attack vector, ie social engineering or malicious of incompetent inside actors.
