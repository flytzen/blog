<p>We have just developed and gone live with a new website for <a href="http://www.neworbit.co.uk">NewOrbit Ltd.</a></p>  <p>NewOrbit is the company I run with Sean, where we develop custom-fit, web-based solutions for our clients. It’s an exciting venture which we have spent the last year getting fully up and running. It’s high on my to-do list to start blogging about everything we are doing.</p>
