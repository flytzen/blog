<p>I have just migrated my blog from FTP publishing to a custom domain on Blogspot. I tend to use Windows Live Writer to write blog posts, but the image publishing didn’t work; If I tried to upload an image through Live Writer I got a “File Upload Failed” with the server returning a 403 error. </p>  <p>Oddly, it worked fine when I posted images directly through Blogger.</p>  <p>Turns out that I needed a Picassa album – Blogger itself could cope with me not having set it up properly, but Live Writer couldn’t. So, just a quick trip to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com">http://picasaweb.google.com</a>, log in with my Google account, answer a few questions and all is now good.</p>
