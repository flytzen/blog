<p>Ever since I left Denmark I've maintained a blog in Danish, on and off, to keep my friends and family back home updated on what I am up to. As time has gone by, I found myself updating it less and less frequently - not least because I found it frustrating not to be able to write about what goes on in the UK. I like to comment on a lot of things, but a lot of things have no relevance either outside the UK or to a non-technical crowd. So, I figured I would try a blog in English.
