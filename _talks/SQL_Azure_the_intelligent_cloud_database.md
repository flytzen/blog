SQL Azure uses machine learning and sophisticated algorithms to provide you a "DBA in a box" that monitors your SQL database 24x7, automatically optimising performance and monitoring for security threats in real-time.

Based on my personal experience with running several large-scale systems on SQL Azure and a joint presentation with Microsoft at Ignite on the subject, this talk gives an overview of how SQL Azure helps you to keep your databases in Azure *secure* and *fast* without needing to be a DBA.  

The talk is rich in real-world examples of how these features have solved real problems in a range of [NewOrbit](https://www.neworbit.co.uk)'s applications.  
Features covered include;

- Threat Detection
- Auto Tuning
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Intelligent Insights
