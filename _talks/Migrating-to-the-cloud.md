For most organisations, it's no longer a question of if you should move to the cloud, but of how, when and how much.

Whether you are planning to move to the cloud or you are already there, this talk will address a number of the common questions and pitfalls, such as;

- Will a move to the cloud jeopardise or improve my compliance and security stance?

- Is it actually cheaper or more expensive than on-premise?

- What are the most common mistakes people make when moving to the cloud?

- Should I just replicate my on-premise setup in the cloud - or should I rewrite everything from scratch?
