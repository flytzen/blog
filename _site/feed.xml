&lt;p&gt;I believe it’s a revolution on par with the move to web and I think many people working in the industry are yet to fully realise this. If you are a business analyst, architect, developer or even a business process specialist, your world is about to be turned upside down and you will have to learn a completely new skill-set or face becoming increasingly irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are quite likely to read this as alarmist and you will probably want to dismiss what I am saying. These may be some of the things you want to tell yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A business process is a business process. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;No, it’s not. AI allows many business process to be completely re-defined or eliminated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You still need to build - and know how to build - all the resilience and scale and micro services and database and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;True - but it’s no longer enough and you may find yourself being really good at solving the wrong problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real people don’t want to [make some change you can’t imagine should change].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Except, people do change - and more and more rapidly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think more of this as an opportunity than a threat. But, it does require you to accept you are going to be a beginner again, for a while, allow yourself to learn and to challenge everything you already know. I am on this journey myself and I don’t know the answers yet - but I am enjoying exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I am talking somewhat interchangeably about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and bots here. They are not the same and I am not even going to try to get the categories right, because that is not the point of this post; I am just going to talk about the impact “all of that stuff” could have on how we build software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;automating-routine-tasks&quot;&gt;Automating routine tasks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing that springs to mind when you talk about things like Machine Learning is to automate routine tasks. The canonical example is image recognition such as recognising hand writing or categorising pictures of animals into species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-image-classification-why-its-challenging-where-we-ve-been-and-what-s-next-93b56948fcef&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/ClassifyPictures.png&quot; alt=&quot;Picure of photos classified into animal species&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe more relevant to people likely to read this post is things like assessing the contents of online forms to decide on actions.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, today you may have people submitting an annual health survey and have a health practitioner review these questionnaires to assess who are fine, who should receive a phone call, who should have a face-to-face visit and so. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; automate that today using hard-coded rules, but it’s probably a lot easier to analyse what the health practitioner actually decides and then train a Machine Learning model on that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical teams, there are a few things you can do now to start this journey;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand that it’s not about getting to 100% accuracy. In most cases, Machine Learning models will spit out a &lt;strong&gt;probability&lt;/strong&gt; so you can put a rule in to say that when that probability is less than, say, 90% then this thing is referred to a human being for assessment. &lt;br /&gt;
This data can then be used to further refine the model, making it ever more accurate (you should also randomly refer some high-probability cases to a human on an ongoing basis to check and adjust the model over time).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about setting your software up so you can start gathering the data: Without a training set, you can’t train the model in the first place. So build the system so 100% of cases go to a human for now and design it so the &lt;em&gt;decision&lt;/em&gt; is clearly recorded along with the original input. &lt;br /&gt;
That thing about recording the decision clearly is very often overlooked when you are just focused on the process and you are not thinking about the future potential for using Machine Learning.
Once you have had some data through, you can start training a model - and the UI you built stays relevant for dealing with the edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;understanding-what-is-normal&quot;&gt;Understanding what is normal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much more subtle - and potentially pervasive - application is when a system starts to learn what’s “normal” and start to react on its own when things are “not normal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best examples at the moment is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Application Insights&lt;/a&gt;. When you add App Insights to your system, it starts recording a lot of information, including requests, dependency calls, errors etc etc. You can, of course, view this in the traditional way but App Insights will also use Machine Learning to automatically build up a baseline of what’s normal and alert you when something is not normal.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, you may get an alert saying “between 10:03 and 10:07am 5% of calls to [some dependency] failed - normally only 1% fail”. Or similar things for duration or request volume etc. The key thing here is that you do not need to set up any special rules to get these alerts, the machine learning model figures it out on its own.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/AppInsightsAutoDetection.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example alert from Application Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure also has similar things for security, threat detection and logins, where they establish a baseline for “normal” and alert you to unusual things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use this approach in many different ways in your own software. For example, a known indicator of mental health problems is if someone all of a sudden starts working a lot more hours. So you could use Machine Learning to automatically establish a baseline for “normal” hours &lt;em&gt;for each individual&lt;/em&gt; in your company (assuming they record timesheets) and flag it up to their manager if all of a sudden their patterns change, giving you a chance to intervene early. There are standard tools out there to help you with that, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/&quot;&gt;Azure’s Anomaly Detector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are designing systems, these kind of technologies need to be in your mind. Do you rely on someone manually checking for deviations or do you have alerts or hard-coded rules to detect anomalies?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;make-suggestions-and-correct-errors&quot;&gt;Make suggestions and correct errors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you receive a text message on your phone or an IM on LinkedIn, you will often be given some suggested answers; These are based on Machine Learning to analyse what the message sent to you was about and what people normally respond with in similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/LinkedInIM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of LinkedIn suggesting replies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have similar things in a UI where, for example, the system learns over time what kind and level of expenses a person normally records and alerts them if they enter something that is unusual for them. These are not system-wide rules, simply knowing that it’s normal for a particular individual to claim £50 for train tickets, but not £500. Or maybe that when you record mileage, more often than not it’s to a particular location so it can auto-suggest the description and distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of examples get longer, the more you allow yourself to think about it, starting with detecting deviations from normal to understanding what you probably meant and suggesting that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autodraw.com/&quot;&gt;Google’s Autodraw experiment&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are thinking about both UX and business processes - these kind of technologies need to be in your mind. Are there places where users make mistakes and we can help them not to? Are there whole new categories of problems we simply haven’t been able to solve before?
One thing’s for sure, this is becoming the new normal so you need to incorporate it in your design thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;intent-driven-ui&quot;&gt;Intent driven UI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is probably the most challenging and different area. 
It’s always been the case that good UX starts with &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;. You need to know what the user wants to achieve and then design the UX to make it easy to get there. With things like bots, we now often use natural language processing to derive intent from normal speech. I see many/most software interfaces for &lt;em&gt;occasional&lt;/em&gt; users needing to adopt this kind of conversational UI. But AI is not magic and making this work well is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me use an example to illustrate what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to book a holiday you can probably describe it really easily to another person. Maybe “I just need to get away for a week, somewhere quiet where the kids have stuff to do. Just to get some rest and not have to think too much. It must not be too expensive, but it does need to be of a decent quality”. If you said that to an experienced travel agent, they may ask you a few follow-up questions, and would then quickly be able to suggest a few options for you. How you respond to those options (too hot, too far) would help them to better understand your needs and they would refine their suggestions. In the end, they would probably give you a list of only a handful of suggestions, even if there may be 100 trips that match your criteria because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Barry-Schwartz/dp/0062449923/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&quot;&gt;choice is overrated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine doing that same journey on most travel booking sites that exists today. You will be given a plethora of filters and tick-boxes so you can review every holiday option going. Except, you don’t know what half the options really mean except you know that to go somewhere quiet you need to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; select any of the ones that say “great night-life” or “18-30 special”. It usually ends up being an exhaustive and often frustrating journey through a bunch of options, comparing and contrasting with a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/HolidayBooking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a travel booking site&quot; /&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;I do like Crystal’s site that I stole this picture from - I think it’s one of the better ones out there, but it illustrates the point nicely. Hope they will forgive me.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a more conversational UI and Machine Learning techniques, that journey could be much more like talking to an operator. Understand me right, building that system is &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;; current Artificial Intelligence is not magic and cannot “think” in any meaningful way. Underneath the covers, that nice conversation with the user still has to be translated into those same tick-boxes, so you can show them filtered results. Natural Language Processing can &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; - but you need to identify all the intents yourself. This is not trivial but I truly believe this is where software design for occasional users is going. I believe we may see a (temporary) upsurge in slightly more hybrid solutions where artificial intelligence techniques are used but with operators being pulled in when the AI does not know what to do. However, the data gathered during those interactions will feed back into the AI model and the need for operator intervention will taper off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the technology and the patterns there to build the dream travel booking site I describe here yet? Probably not. But it’s coming and you should start thinking about how you can start gathering the data to train those models; what can you do today to capture information about how your users express their intent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, what about the travel agent? Should they talk to an AI as well? I don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; so. After all, we are trying to model the AI on an experienced travel agent and it would probably be counter-productive to have the travel agent interfacing with an inferior emulation of themselves. In other words, there is very much still a place for complicated user interfaces with lots of options for the users who use your system every day - but casual users are going to expect something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice this isn’t just for complicated things like travel agent bookings; it could be as simple as a customer wanting to buy a widget from your online store. At the same time, don’t forget that sometimes a user do want to have all the information and not just a part of it, so model that intent into your considerations as well (okay, I am drifting towards general UX design here, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building conversational UIs that actually work is really hard - but it is getting easier every day and it will start to become an expectation for more and more people. Just think about how we engage with our various digital assistants. Even the humble Google Search is a lot more than just a “search”, you can ask it to translate things or do math amongst many other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When will your customers begin to expect that they can just log in to your portal and ask a question like “when will my t-shirt arrive”, rather than having to click on their account, list their orders, click on the right one and go through to “tracking”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;re-imaging-problems-fundamentally&quot;&gt;Re-imaging problems fundamentally&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the above has really been about how we change existing types of software and problems to take advantage of AI to make it better or more efficient. For most of us, that is probably the primary thing we need to worry about because that &lt;strong&gt;isn’t going away anytime soon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is also another whole class of problems that we can start to solve that simply wasn’t possible before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saladmoney.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Salad Money&lt;/a&gt;, a Social Enterprise that provide small, short-term loans. They use Open Banking and have fully automated their loan approval process, making it possible to provide these small, cheap loans cost-effectively and at scale. As they build up more data, they will be able to use Machine Learning to provide more tailored products to individuals, without having complicated or unfair assessment processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This general ability to take what used to be quite complicated things that required expert involvement, automate it and deploy it at scale is something I, personally, am quite excited about and I think we will see a lot of innovation in that space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-do-i-do-now&quot;&gt;So what do I do now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on the journey myself, I don’t know the answers. 
I spent quite a long time over the last few years trying to get my head into how it all really works and I bought several books on the subject because that’s how I have always approaches learning new technical topics. But most of the books very quickly descend into deep math and most seem designed to help you design Machine Learning algorithms - which is probably not what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I had a re-think and I decided on a smarter goal for my learning, at least for now;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to be able to recognise where AI technologies can potentially help or change how I design software&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may sound obvious, but I don’t think I have internalised AI enough that I can (yet) instinctively recognise where I should think about AI. 
That is obviously the first step, because once I identify these opportunities, I can then target my learning at something much more specific and/or hire help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way I can achieve that is by seeing as many examples as I can. That means going to events, reading blog posts and watching videos. I do like to see how these things are put together, but that’s not the real purpose yet. I just want to load my brain up with examples so I can start to see the patterns of what is possible and start recognising the situations where I, too, should apply AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a secondary goal, I also want to learn enough about the practical realities that I can at least do a proof-of-concept in order to show that there could be value.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, I have identified some client scenarios that can benefit from automating classification as described above. I can use high-level tools, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MLNET.07&quot;&gt;ML.Nets Model Builder&lt;/a&gt; to do a proof-of-concept without understanding the difference between a Bayes Classifier and a Logistic Regression algorithm, knowing how to do hyperparameter tuning or even clean my data that much. Would I put the result into production? Of course not. But if I can show a model that has 80% accuracy after tinkering for a couple of hours, I can create the business case for engaging a data scientist to build the real thing. And yes, I am learning Jupyter Notebooks and all that as well, but the truth is that I don’t actually need the grown-up tools yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://neworbit.co.uk&quot;&gt;NewOrbit&lt;/a&gt; we are actively embracing this journey. We are working on training programs for everyone from sales, through business analysts to developers so they can help our customers take advantage of this revolution in software design. We are also building some of our own products in order to test our skills and showcase what’s possible (and to have a bit of fun along the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you learning AI? Do you think this will affect software design as much as I do? Leave a comment with your views or contact me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/flytzen&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - I’d love to discuss this with more people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="Technology" /><category term="AI" /><category term="Azure" /><summary type="html">AI will change how we think about, design and build software.

I was really impressed by how well organised the event was and just how dedicated and professional the audience were. We are talking about people giving up their Friday night to hear about security in Azure as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ptrstpp950&quot;&gt;Piotr Stapp&lt;/a&gt;’s talk about migrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://dotnetomaniak.pl/&quot;&gt;https://dotnetomaniak.pl/&lt;/a&gt; to Azure.&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently this was the first ever talk done in English at rg-dev, but that didn’t feel like a barrier at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go to Rzeszow quite frequently these days as NewOrbit has opened a small, but growing, office there (&lt;a href=&quot;https://neworbit.pl/careers/&quot;&gt;interested in joining us?&lt;/a&gt;). I look forward to attending more rg-dev meetups, though I probably need to work a bit more on my Polish :) I am consistently impressed by the developers I meet in Rzeszow and look forward to working with more of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides from the talk can be downloaded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flytzen/SecurityTalk/blob/master/Secure%20Your%20Web%20App%20Presentation.pptx?raw=true&quot;&gt;PowerPoint format from GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or you can see them (without animations) on Slideshare below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/vZ12nwRamiEwrr&quot; width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;485&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covers the things you can do to secure web apps and APIs hosted in Azure Web Apps and Functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outline&quot;&gt;Outline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 480px; height: 360px; margin: 10px; position: relative;float:right;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width:480px; height:360px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/f4062454-7eb7-4e7a-abca-2d244417011b&quot; id=&quot;Gf4kpeh9VZr3&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;concepts&quot;&gt;Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand your exposure; how much at risk are you and how much work should you do to secure your app?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand that you are probably more at risk from internal actors making mistakes with data than you are from external hackers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should think about your security at three levels;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; someone from getting in&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to &lt;em&gt;detect&lt;/em&gt; that someone is attacking you&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to &lt;em&gt;mitigate&lt;/em&gt; the attack&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-in&quot;&gt;Getting in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Web Apps and Functions are already protected by a Firewall. It is impractical, if not impossible, to add your own firewall unless you use an App Service Environment. If you must, you can add a WAF and lock down the access to your web app to only the IP address of the WAF.&lt;br /&gt;
SSL Certificates in Azure are harder than they should be, the talk covers a few different options and their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly encourage you to use Azure ADB2C (and/or Azure AD) for authentication instead of having your own usernames and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-management&quot;&gt;Secret Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problem with both security and auditing is that the application needs passwords to access certain services; Those passwords need to be stored somewhere, which usually means they are exposed to various people. This leads to auditing and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Azure Key Vault and Managed Identity it is surprisingly easy to eliminate this problem; there is a lot to learn before you can do it - but the actual implementation is really easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-isolation&quot;&gt;Network Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, all your back-end services such as Cosmos, SQL, storage and so on are open to other services running in Azure and some are open to the Internet. It is surprisingly easy to set up a private Virtual Network and set your back-end services so they can only be accessed from that virtual network - and then allow your web app to talk to that network. You can even set up micro-services hosted in Azure Web Apps or Functions in this way, completely blocking access from anything other than your web app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main challenge with the virtual networks is that 90% of the documentation on them has to do with features that are irrelevant when you are using Web Apps instead of VMs or Cloud Services, so it’s mainly about knowing what to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encryption&quot;&gt;Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the attacker is in - or the well-meaning employee is accessing data they probably shouldn’t - it is extremely helpful that the data is encrypted. The obvious at-rest and transport encryption is there by default, but you can use Always Encrypted and Client-side encryption to easily encrypt data at the application level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;detection&quot;&gt;Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked areas of security is detecting when someone is attacking you. If you don’t know someone is trying to hack you or that some well-meaning employee is accessing data they shouldn’t, you can’t do anything about it.
Azure has a rich set of features to help alert you when something isn’t right. In the talk I focus on Application Insights, Threat Protection and Advanced Data Security.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="Azure" /><summary type="html">I did a talk on &quot;How to secure your web-app in Azure&quot; at rg-dev</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Find SELECT N+1 with Application Insights</title><link href="https://www.lytzen.name/2019/05/20/find-select-nplus1-with-app-insights.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Find SELECT N+1 with Application Insights" /><published>2019-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.lytzen.name/2019/05/20/find-select-nplus1-with-app-insights</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lytzen.name/2019/05/20/find-select-nplus1-with-app-insights.html">&lt;p&gt;ORMs like Entity Framework are good for many things - but they also make it easy to write “SELECT N+1 queries”. This is when you thought you just did one SQL call but you make one call to retrieve the list of records and then (at least) one more call for each row in the resultset, because you loop over the data and inadvertently auto-expand a property. You rarely spot it in development and even in production it is sometimes hard to see; It may well be that a particular operation causes your code to call SQL 500 times, but that may take less than a second so the operation may not even show up at the top of your “performance offenders” list. But, it’s still a lot of traffic to send to SQL and, combined with the fact that SELECT N+1 problems are usually very easy to fix, it’s worthwhile hunting them down and sorting them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default Application Insights log every Request made to your web/api server and log every &lt;em&gt;dependency call&lt;/em&gt;, such as database and micro service call you do. It connects the two together by giving the dependency call a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;operation_ParentId&lt;/code&gt; that is the same as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; of the request.
In short, you can join the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; to list each web/api request and show how many SQL calls it generated and how long they took to run in aggregate like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;requests 
| project name, id, duration
| join kind = leftouter (
   dependencies 
   | where type  == 'SQL'
   | project sqlid = id, operation_ParentId , sqlduration = duration 
) on $left.id == $right.operation_ParentId 
| summarize sqlopscount = countif(isnotempty(sqlid)), sqlopsduration = sum(sqlduration) by name, id, duration
| order by sqlopscount  desc 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this query will show each individual request made. You may want to roll that up further to see the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of call - but I find that quite often it is helpful to know the exact call to make it easier to reproduce it.&lt;br /&gt;
I am currently working through a legacy app that has a lot of these kind of problems; I look at the result of this query and then set to work fixing them. It’s a very easy way to find major causes of stress on the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cosmosdb&quot;&gt;CosmosDb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the same query, just change &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; to “Azure DocumentDB”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-other-dependencies---or-if-my-sql-calls-are-not-logged&quot;&gt;What about other dependencies - or if my SQL calls are not logged?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running ASP.Net (Core or otherwise) on Azure Web Apps, your SQL calls are automatically logged as dependencies. In other scenarios, this may not happen automatically. You may need to install certain extensions to pick them up - or you may have to write your own. Incidentally, writing your own can also be very helpful if you want to do the same statistics for something other than SQL.&lt;br /&gt;
In short, you can write code to wrap dependency operations in calls to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TelemetryClient.StartOperation&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TelemetryClient.StopOperation&lt;/code&gt; - see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/custom-operations-tracking&quot;&gt;Telemetry Client documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="Azure" /><summary type="html">With ORMs it's very easy to write code that calls SQL many times to serve a single web requests, and it can be hard to find it.

I had written lots of high-throughput, high-performance async code so it should be really easy to write this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I began writing the code to prove the things I knew - it turned out that I knew nothing at all and all my assumptions were wrong. The result was a much better talk where I describe the fundamentals of how Async in C# works and explain a lot of the misconceptions people, such as myself, have. So far I have delivered the talk to my colleagues at work, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/&quot;&gt;Dotnet Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dddsouthwest.com/&quot;&gt;DDD South West&lt;/a&gt; - thanks for having me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation and the code samples &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flytzen/Async.Presentation&quot;&gt;are on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and I have also recorded it as a video. For practical reasons, the video was recorded in five parts; you can see them all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzVMzBEpuJg&amp;amp;list=PLbwbf2ZiIT4N7G08GcCd1Z64N8tfgKfIn&quot;&gt;in one playlist&lt;/a&gt; or see the individual parts below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1---introduction&quot;&gt;Part 1 - Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons to use async - some of them are true, others are not. In the introduction we have a quick look at these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2---brain-teasers&quot;&gt;Part 2 - Brain Teasers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick run through some code examples that may give you different results than you expect. It sets the stage for the next video about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-3---how-it-works&quot;&gt;Part 3 - How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat of the presentation and by far the longest video at nearly 20 minutes. It goes into detail about what really happens when you run async code and explains where threads come into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4---deadlocks&quot;&gt;Part 4 - Deadlocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work with ASP.Net “old” (i.e. not Core) or you write Desktop apps then you have probably heard that using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.Wait&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.Result&lt;/code&gt; can result in deadlocks. And you may have experienced that some code will only deadlock sometimes. This video builds on part 3 to explain why the deadlocks occur. It does primarily focus on ASP.Net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-5---tips&quot;&gt;Part 5 - Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up I have collected some tips that you can use, including some on how to utilise Async to easily parallelise network writes and other async work in a way that can speed up the throughput of your code very substantially. After the last time I gave this talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tjrobinson&quot;&gt;Tom Robinson&lt;/a&gt; kindly pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md#prefer-asyncawait-over-directly-returning-task&quot;&gt;these comments&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidfowl&quot;&gt;David Fowler&lt;/a&gt; which put a bit more nuance around my tip to “just return the task”; consider your circumstances and make the choices that are right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

If I could ever retain Powershell syntax, I could write a clever script that would loop through all the subscriptions and do what was needed. Alas, that forever eludes me so I just opted for a few Azure CLI commands with a bit of editing in an editor. Still much faster than going throgh the UI repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-tenants&quot;&gt;Multiple tenants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, this doesn’t apply so feel free to skip this section if it is irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;
When you log in with Azure CLI, you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; all your subscriptions across tenants - but the command to add a user to a subscription only works for the tenant you are currently “logged in to”. It can be confusing.&lt;br /&gt;
To see the tenant IDs for all your subscriptions you can run this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; az account list --query &quot;[].{tenantId:tenantId, name:name} | sort_by([],&amp;amp;tenantId)&quot;  --output table
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to “login” to a specific tenant you need to :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;az login --tenant &amp;lt;tenant id&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do the stuff below for each tenant id&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-list-of-subscription-ids&quot;&gt;Getting the list of subscription IDs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get the list of subscription ids for a given tenant id:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;az account list --query &quot;[] | [?tenantId == 'foo.onmicrosoft.com'].id&quot; --output table
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the tenant id may be in this form or may be a guid - not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, if you only have a single tenant, just do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;az account list --query &quot;[].id&quot; --output table
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;add-the-user-to-all-the-subscriptions&quot;&gt;Add the user to all the subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the list of subscription IDs into a text editor and modify each line to look like this (111… being the subscription id):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;az role assignment create --role &quot;Owner&quot; --assignee foo@bar.com --scope /subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy those lines into your console and shortly after your new user will be an owner of all your subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="DevOps" /><category term="Azure" /><summary type="html">Add a new user to all my Azure subscriptions using Azure CLI</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Publish Nuget packages with Azure Dev Ops</title><link href="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/10/03/publish-nuget-packages-with-azure-devops.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Publish Nuget packages with Azure Dev Ops" /><published>2018-10-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.lytzen.name/2018/10/03/publish-nuget-packages-with-azure-devops</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/10/03/publish-nuget-packages-with-azure-devops.html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever I decide to create a Nuget package, whether for OSS or to publish on our internal MyGet feed I end up spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out a flow that works for testing and publishing. I guess it’s one of those things that, once you have figured it out, becomes easy but it has eluded me until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My requirements are quite specific and may not be to everyone’s liking;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html&quot;&gt;GitFlow&lt;/a&gt; to control my branches, including using Pull Requests etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever a commit is made to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; (or a PR is merged in), I want to publish that package with a “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-pre.123&lt;/code&gt;” suffix as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/&quot;&gt;SemVer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever the same happens to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; I want to publish a “full” release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t explicitly covered it here, but it would also be nice to have packages sat in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;release/*&lt;/code&gt; branch be published with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-beta.1&lt;/code&gt; suffix - but you can easily extend it to cover that scenario as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show how to set up GitHub with Azure DevOps to do this for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am basing this on “modern” (i.e. 2017) csproj files, the ones where the package references are in the .csproj files. This came in with .Net Core but works fine with Full Framework projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-numbers&quot;&gt;Version numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create and publish Nuget packages you can specify the version number you want to use on the command line and there is ample of documentation about how to do that with Azure DevOps and other builder services, including MyGet build services, which I used previously.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I really like more control so I like to control the version number in my .csproj file - but I want the build service to automatically append &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-pre.nnn&lt;/code&gt; when it published from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that there are two ways you can specify the version number in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.2.3-pre.987&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionPrefix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.2.3&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/VersionPrefix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;pre.987&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the above will create packages with version &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.2.3-pre.987&lt;/code&gt;. The naming of the Prefix and Suffix threw me for the longest time - I thought they were meant to interact with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; attribute somehow, but Prefix and Suffix is more like “main part” and “extra bit” and you should &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; those &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing to understand is that you can use conditionals and environment variables in the attributes. 
For my purposes, this is what I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionPrefix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1.2.3&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/VersionPrefix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot; '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug' &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;debug&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- For local/debug builds --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot; '$(Build_SourceBranch)' == 'refs/heads/develop' &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;pre.$(Build_BuildID)&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This is using variables that are specific to Azure Dev Ops Pipelines --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionPrefix&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; here is really the proper version I want my package to have.&lt;br /&gt;
I have an empty &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as default. I probably don’t actually need that tag, but it helps make it clearer in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/code&gt; variable that is provided by the dotnet build process; if I build in Debug mode, the package version will become &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.2.3-debug&lt;/code&gt;. This is mainly useful for local scenarios as I will always build in Release mode for publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;VersionSuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; after that looks at an environment variable provided by Azure DevOps when you are running in the pipeline. This means that if I am building from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; branch in an Azure Pipeline then it will set the Suffix. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Build_BuildID&lt;/code&gt; is another environment variable provided by Azure Dev Ops to the pipeline, which will always increment. So, in the example here I may end up with a version number of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1.2.3-pre.6239&lt;/code&gt;. As long as that last number reliably increments (which it does) you are fine for package control.&lt;br /&gt;
There is another variable called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Build_BuildNumber&lt;/code&gt; which you may be tempted to use instead. However, I found some scenarios where that variable would have the name of the pipeline instead of a number, which causes the build to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more advanced scenarios you can invent your own attributes, which become variables in their own right, which you can then re-combine in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;publish-symbols&quot;&gt;Publish Symbols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, when you create a Nuget package, it &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdb&lt;/code&gt; files (the debug symbols). In the past, the answer was to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--include-symbols&lt;/code&gt; when building your Nuget pacakge. This will create &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; Nuget packages, one with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdb&lt;/code&gt; files and one without. Up until a few years ago, you could publish both of these together to Nuget, but then that changed and now you have to publish the symbols package to a different server with a different API key and a different command. It becomes a real headache, especially because of the inconsistent and out of date documentation. Hence why I have included it in this guide; I either need to tell you how to publish symbols from within the pipeline or tell you how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink&quot;&gt;SourceLink&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue. SourceLink provides a way to link your package to a specific commit on, say, GitHub or elsewhere. I do recommend using SourceLink as it does so much more than just give you the PDB file - but even if you can’t or won’t, there is a gem hidden in the documentation, namely this line to add to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-xml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;AllowedOutputExtensionsInPackageBuildOutputFolder&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  $(AllowedOutputExtensionsInPackageBuildOutputFolder);.pdb
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/AllowedOutputExtensionsInPackageBuildOutputFolder&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this will do is include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdb&lt;/code&gt; file in your main Nuget package, meaning you don’t need a separate symbols package at all. Of course, using the full SourceLink is much better. Incidentally, this also works for private repos without sharing the source publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variables&quot;&gt;Variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are looking at the documentation for Azure DevOps there are lists of variables scattered in different places. You will probably also find that the same variable in some context is referred to as Build.BuildId and in another as BUILD_BUILDID etc. Sometimes you have to reference it as %BUILD_BUILDID%, other times as $(Build.BuildId) and yet other times as $(Build_BuildID). It does sort of make sense, but as a good starting point, when designing your YAML file, I recommend adding this task somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;show variables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just dumps all the environment variables to the log, so you can have a look through to see what is actually available for you to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-pipeline&quot;&gt;Setting up a pipeline.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to set up a build pipeline on Azure DevOps from GitHub is to add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines&quot;&gt;Azure Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; GitHub App to your Github account. When you connect it to a repository, it will walk you through setting up a default pipeline; just choose the “empty” option. This pipeline will save a YAML file into your repository and will set up two triggers. One is a simple trigger to run the pipeline for any commit on any branch, the other is a specific integration into Pull Requests; essentially any pull request will be run through the pipeline and if it fails it will block the PR from being merged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the YAML file I ended up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This only runs for master and develop. Plus a seperate trigger is run for PR validation. This means commits to branches not in a PR won't get tested. Choices, choices...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;NewOrbit.NewOrbit.AddOne - build and test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;buildConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Release&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;vmImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;vs2017-win2016'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;show variables&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;dotnet restore&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;dotnet restore&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration) --no-restore&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;DotNetCoreCLI@2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;**/*tests/*.csproj'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;--configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$(buildConfiguration)'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;dotnet pack --configuration $(buildConfiguration) --no-build --output %Build_ArtifactStagingDirectory%&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and(succeeded(), or(eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'master'),eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'develop')))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;pack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;NuGetCommand@2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and(succeeded(), or(eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'master'),eq(variables['Build.SourceBranchName'], 'develop')))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;nuGetFeedType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;publishFeedCredentials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;NewOrbit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;MyGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Nuget'&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;packagesToPush&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/**/*.nupkg'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/code&gt; part limits this to only run on checkins to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; (note, some of the documentation has a more verbose syntax that seems to not work). The Pull Request trigger still works so all Pull Request and all commits into an open Pull Request will be run through this pipeline. But, for me, I don’t need CI to run on every commit on every feature branch. That’s just me - if you want the pipeline to run for every commit, just delete the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/code&gt; section altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steps through restore and build should be obvious. The step after that uses a special Azure DevOps task to run the unit tests, which ensures that the results are reported in a nice way in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;script: dotnet pack&lt;/code&gt; packs the Nuget package and outputs the package to a particular holding area. To be honest, I could probably forgo the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; parameter but it helps to understand what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;
The key thing here is the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/code&gt; line. This will ensure that a Nuget package is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; created if the build is of either the develop or the master branch. If you wanted to publish “beta” versions from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;release/*&lt;/code&gt; branches, it should be straight forward to extend the condition accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
Incidentally, there is an Azure DevOps task for creating the Nuget package but I couldn’t get it to work so used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet pack&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final task publishes the created nuget package to Nuget. In this case I am publishing it to Myget; In order to do this, you first need to go to your &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; in Azure DevOps, go to Project Settings and then select Service Connections (it’s well hidden). Then add a connection to Nuget or MyGet or whatever Nuget feed you want to publish to. You put the &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; of that service connection in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publishFeedCredentials&lt;/code&gt; property in the YAML file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you wanted to publish packages from your develop branch to MyGet and the ones from Master to NuGet you can hopefully see how you can just duplicate the last task and change the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/code&gt; statements to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; There is a bug in Azure DevOps that may result in an error saying something like that your pipeline doesn’t have the right permissiom to use the service connection. It’s easy to fix by following the guidance &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/resources?view=vsts&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approvals&quot;&gt;Approvals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach described above will publish packages immediately. If you wanted, you can easily set it up so you have to manually approve the publish. In short, you need to replace the final publish task in the YAML above with a Publish Artifacts task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;PublishBuildArtifacts@1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;artifactName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;package'&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will copy whatever is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%Build_ArtifactStagingDirectory%&lt;/code&gt; directory (where we put the Nuget package before) and make it available as an artefact of the build. Once you run the pipeline, look at the build and you will see an Artefact. If you click on that, Azure DevOps will take you through a wizard to set up a release pipeline, which you can then use to add manual approval before you publish the package to Nuget.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="DevOps" /><category term="Azure" /><summary type="html">Use GitFlow and Azure Devops to automatically publish Nuget packages with sensible version numbers</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hierarchy IDs for Fun and Performance</title><link href="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/06/27/hierarchyid-for-fun-and-performance.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hierarchy IDs for Fun and Performance" /><published>2018-06-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-06-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.lytzen.name/2018/06/27/hierarchyid-for-fun-and-performance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/06/27/hierarchyid-for-fun-and-performance.html">&lt;p&gt;Many systems have a &lt;em&gt;hierarchy&lt;/em&gt; in the data. This may be an organisation hierarchy, or maybe a hierarchy caused by a multi-tenant system or a combination thereof.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s relatively easy to model a hierarchy in a relational or document database - it is much harder to effectively filter which part of the tree a given user can see or act on. You may find yourself traversing up or down the tree or making multi-table joins.&lt;br /&gt;
A simpler solution is to use a Hierarchy ID. In a relational database, you would implement this as a string field with a delimiter-separated list of its parents, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;120/23/47/19&lt;/code&gt;. If a user is allowed to see everything from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;120/23&lt;/code&gt; downwards, you can easily search for all the records where the Hierarchy ID starts with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;120/23&lt;/code&gt; (indexes will work well with that). In document databases it ma be more optimal to have an array of all the Ancestor IDs instead of a string value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post explores the use of Hierarchy IDs to make filtering easy and performant. In addition, it has some pointers about how to set up hierarchical configuration using the same Hierarchy ID you are implementing anyway. Of course, you could just use a graph database and then it’s a different story altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multi-tenant hierarchy may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lytzen.name/assets/fixedhierarchy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fixed Hierarchy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll call this is a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy as it has a fixed depth and different types at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organisational hierarchy may look like this;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.lytzen.name/assets/selfreferrentialhierarchy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Self-referential Hierarchy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll call this a &lt;em&gt;self-referential&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy as each layer in the hierarchy refers to parent/children of the same type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://neworbit.co.uk&quot;&gt;NewOrbit&lt;/a&gt; we sometimes build multi-tenanted systems which has resellers, who have system customers, who in turn have organisational hierarchies so it can quickly become a very deep hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are creating your data structure, whether in a relational database such as Azure SQL or a document database such as Mongo or CosmosDb, you will typically have a Parent ID on records in the hierarchy as illustrated above. This is easy at write time and makes it relatively easy to traverse the hierarchy both up and down. 
However, when you need to get access to a only a part of the tree or indeed multiple subsets of the tree then it becomes very hard to query efficiently and performantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example with the self-referential hierarchy, imagine in the illustration above that a given user is allowed to see the details of anybody who is in Bob’s hierarchy; you’d need to write a recursive function to keep drilling down the layers until there are no more subordinates. That means running many different SQL queries or using UDFs (which in turn will run a recursive function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively in the fixed hierarchy, imagine if a given user has access to see all the projects for three separate branches and they want to see a list of all tasks across all projects they have access to. Or imagine that a Reseller user has access to see all the details for all their Customers, but not for any other Customer - and they want to see a list of all Projects (okay, maybe not the best example in the world, but you get the idea). In that scenario you’d probably write some code that JOINs all the way up the hierarchy and out to various permissions tables, such as “are they in the list that can see the project or in the list that can see the branch or in the list that can see the customer or in the list that can see the reseller”. It may not be that hard to write the code, but it’s easy to end up with a 20-table &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;, which is expensive on a relational database - and impossible if you use CosmosSB which does not support &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I am primarily focusing on how to &lt;em&gt;filter&lt;/em&gt; the data so a user can only see the data they are allowed in an efficient manner. There are other hierarchy scenarios, in particular around set based operations and there are other patterns that are better suited to those than what I am showing here. I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hierarchies-Smarties-Kaufmann-Management-Systems/dp/0123877334&quot;&gt;Joe Celko’s Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties&lt;/a&gt; for understanding more about this. In fact, the lessons that I am expounding on in this post are based on what I learnt from that book many moons ago. Even if you use a document database, it’s still a good read to understand the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-store-hierarchy-ids&quot;&gt;How to store Hierarchy IDs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, you will typically have some kind of Parent ID on each node in the hierarchy (though it’s usually called something more meaningful, such as CustomerID or ManagerID). 
The trick to efficient querying is to maintain a &lt;em&gt;Hierarchy ID&lt;/em&gt; on each record that has all the parent IDs all the way up the tree.&lt;br /&gt;
In a relational database, you would store it as a text string like this (for the Task in the fixed hierarchy example above);
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10/20/57/2/1047&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Document Database you can do the same or use a slightly more efficient approach, which is to store an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; of Ancestor IDs. If your documents use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GUID&lt;/code&gt;s for IDs, then you can just put all the Ancestor IDs in the array. Otherwise (and only in the fixed hierarchy) you could prefix each ID with its record type - but that starts making it too blurry in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL Server has a native Hierarchy ID data type that gives you a few convenience functions, but it is not mapped in Entity Framework so if you use EF you may prefer to just use a normal string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;querying&quot;&gt;Querying&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to query the database you need to be able to search on Hierarchy IDs so ensure there is an index on the field for performance. Next you need to know which Hierarchy IDs a user is allowed to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of a &lt;strong&gt;relational database&lt;/strong&gt; you have a couple of options;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a user will only have access to a few Hierarchy IDs, then you can simply have those on listed on whatever user object (such as a ClaimsPrincipal) you are passing around in your code and you can then do some SQL along the lines of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SELECT FROM xx WHERE HierarchyID LIKE &quot;123/23%&quot; OR HierarchyID LIKE &quot;516/67/43/109%&quot; &lt;/code&gt;. 
If you have many Hierarchy IDs per user then this will end up with a lot of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; statements which can really hurt performance, so be careful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a user has access to many Hierarchy IDs it may be better to maintain a Hierarchy ID table in the database, with each row having a user ID and a Hierarchy ID and then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INNER JOIN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;APPLY&lt;/code&gt; to that table in your query.&lt;br /&gt;
Just be mindful that if a user is allowed two Hierarchy IDs where one is a subset of the other, you will get duplicate records so you need to either use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt; or remove such “duplicates” from the User-HierarchyID table before &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;ing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of a &lt;strong&gt;document database&lt;/strong&gt; that doesn’t support &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/code&gt;s your only option is to keep that list of allowed Hierarchy IDs or Ancestor IDs and then use OR statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mutability-of-the-hierarchy&quot;&gt;Mutability of the hierarchy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hierarchies are essentially immutable, others can change at times. For example, in the example above with customers and projects, it is exceedingly unlikely that a customer will move between resellers or a project will move between customers. In that scenario you can probably treat the Hierarchy ID as write-only and just set it once when you create the records. In the rare circumstance where you may have to change it, you can deal with that as a one-off and handle it manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisation hierarchies, in particular, have an annoying habit of changing over time. If someone’s manager changes, you have to update the Hierarchy IDs all the way down the tree. Depending on the potential size of the tree and your security requirements, this may be done in different ways. Bear in mind that when the CEO of a 100,000 person company changes, that’s a lot of records to update.
In most scenarios you can just have a simple function that recurses through all the affected records and updates each one in turn. You may implement this at the database level or in application code, depending on your requirements. In a relational database you may be tempted to wrap this entire thing in a transaction, but be mindful that this may escalate to a table lock, which may effectively lock your whole system up. Alternatively, updating each record in turn may mean that for a few minutes (for a very large change) some users will see a mixture of the records they used to be able to see and the records they are going to be able to see. The user should never see records they weren’t meant to see; it may just take a few minutes to remove all the records they used to be able to see and add all the new records. 
Users may also need to re-login if you are caching their list of allowed Hierarchy IDs in a session object of some kind. Mostly, these changes are infrequent - at least changes that affect many records - so it’s usually not something to worry too much about, as long as you understand it for your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ease-of-writing-vs-ease-of-reading&quot;&gt;Ease of Writing vs ease of Reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you implement a Hierarchy ID, you are making it more complex to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; data; Whenever you add a node in the hierarchy you now have to set it’s Hierarchy ID. If your tree is mutable, you also need to handle updating the Hierarchy IDs of all children whenever nodes are moved - something that can take considerable time and capacity if a high-level node is moved. Similarly, you may need to write code to maintain a list of “allowed hierarchy IDs” per user.  In other words, Hierarchy IDs adds extra complexity to your system.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, once Hierarchy IDs are in place, your data filtering/security code becomes much easier to write and your database queries will be much more performant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Hierarchy IDs are right for a given solution will, as always, depend on the needs of that system. Some of the key indicators that you may need it are;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep hierarchies with access rights determined at multiple levels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large data sets in a hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-referential hierarchies with access rights set at arbitrary levels (think pretty much any organisational hierarchy with scope-of-control security)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hierarchical-configuration&quot;&gt;Hierarchical Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common requirement to have Hierarchical Configuration where a certain setting is different for a certain part of the tree. For example, you may have some settings that only apply to a particular Reseller, Customer or even Branch etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already implementing Hierarchy IDs in the form of a delimited string, you could have a simple Configuration table that has the Key, the Value and the Hierarchy ID it applies to. 
When you want to find the value for a particular Hierarchy ID for a particular node, you can recursively search for a configuration setting that matches the node’s Hierarchy ID, or it’s parent or the grand parent etc, all the way up to the root. This is obviously not very efficient to query so you would need to cache it (or keep the whole thing in memory if possible), but it makes it very easy to model and extend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you really want is something like (pseudo code)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HierarchyID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SUBSTRING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;node_hierarchy_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LENGTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HierarchyID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may well be able to write a SQL statement something like that, though it will definitely use a table scan - so still cache it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of document database with an array of Ancestor IDs, you’d need to ensure that the Ancestor ID array on the node is sorted by descent level so that you can look for configuration values in the right order (by walking up the tree).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="Databases" /><category term="Performance" /><category term="SQL" /><category term="CosmosDB" /><summary type="html">Storing hierarchies in a database is easy - but applying hierarchical security and configuration can be very difficult and a significant performance problem.

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The authorization token is not valid at the current time. Please create another token and retry (token start time: Tue, 08 May 2018 09:17:33 GMT, token expiry time: Tue, 08 May 2018 09:32:33 GMT, current server time: Tue, 08 May 2018 09:11:00 GMT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important things to note here are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;token start time: Tue, 08 May 2018 09:17:33 GMT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;current server time: Tue, 08 May 2018 09:11:00 GMT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The token has a start time &lt;em&gt;in the future&lt;/em&gt;. As a consequence, any request to CosmosDB made with this token fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took us a while to diagnose this because we just assumed that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;current server time&lt;/code&gt; referred to the time on the Web server, but it actually refers to the time on the CosmosDB server.&lt;br /&gt;
We could see that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;current server time&lt;/code&gt; was correct, in that it matched the known correct time on other servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it boils down to is that the time on our webserver was wrong, specifically it was in the future, and the .Net client SDK was dutifully creating access tokens that started in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running your app on your own server or a VM, you can stop reading now and go reset the time on your server and all will be well. What was really weird for us was that we are running this in a Web App in Azure App Services. They are supposed to be time synchronised and it simply shouldn’t be possible for their clock to drift. Except it did. We triangulated the problem by running the same code from another location and eventually from a web app deployed to a different App Service Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are experiencing this problem in Azure Web App, the TL;DR; is to scale your site &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, for example from an S1 to an S2 and then down again later. Details as to why are below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to remember here is that an App Service Plan is what encapsulates the underlying hardware that actually hosts the App Services. We had an App Service Plan with a single node in it and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Web Apps deployed to this App Service Plan failed with the same error. Which is logical when you think about it, but easy to forget in the heat of battle.&lt;br /&gt;
We confirmed the issue by going to the “Advanced Tools” and, using the Powershell console, ran &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Get-Date&lt;/code&gt;, which showed us that the web-server time was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case we had just a single node in the App Service Plan. If you had multiple nodes and only one had time-drifted, you’d probably see the error intermittently and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Get-Date&lt;/code&gt; would just return the time from whatever server the console happened to be running on. If you suspect this situation, it may be worthwhile scaling your app service plan down to a single node, testing it and scaling out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we needed was for Azure to kill our faulty node so we would automatically roll on to another node with the correct time. Unfortunately there are no tools to do this (and you wouldn’t expect to have to). However, there is a way you can do it and it was literally the process of writing this post that made me think about it, so I’ve just stopped writing to go fix the problem; Simply scale your site &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; and then down again. For example, if you are on an S1, scale to an S2 as this will force Azure to deploy your site on a new underlying machine. You can scale back down again when you are happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Frans Lytzen</name></author><category term="Azure" /><category term="CosmosDB" /><summary type="html">CosmosDB error &quot;The authorization token is not valid at the current time&quot; and how to fix it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Securing your web app in Azure</title><link href="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/04/29/securing-your-webapp-in-azure.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Securing your web app in Azure" /><published>2018-04-29T21:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-04-29T21:40:00+01:00</updated><id>https://www.lytzen.name/2018/04/29/securing-your-webapp-in-azure</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.lytzen.name/2018/04/29/securing-your-webapp-in-azure.html">&lt;p&gt;So you have deployed your web app to Azure. Now, how do you go about making it secure?
I gave a talk on this topic at  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/&quot;&gt;DotNet Oxford&lt;/a&gt; on 24 April 2018 and recorded it. You can view the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video runs through a scenario using an ASP.Net Web App hosted on Azure App Service and covers a number of features you can use to improve your security - as well as a number of features that are not available for App Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covers a lot of ground in an hour and everything is kept at a high level, but is nonetheless heavy on examples and code.&lt;br /&gt;
Watching the video myself, I realised I say “Okay” and “So” way, way too much. Sorry…&lt;/p&gt;
